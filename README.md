# Guide Chimp

*TODO*

## How to Use

NetLicensing JavaScript Client was designed to work both in the browser and in Node.js.

In order to use NetLicensing JavaScript Client, you must include the compiled and minified JavaScript file in your project. There are multiple options for including these pre-compiled files, also known as a distribution, in your website or application.

### Using from a CDN

*TODO*

### Installing with Node.js / npm

NetLicensing JavaScript Client is available on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/guidechimp). Add the following to your `package.json` file and then run `npm install`:
```
"dependencies": {
    "guidechimp": "x.y.z"
}
```

or execute following command in your Node.js environment:

```
$ npm install guidechimp
```

### Manual installation

We strongly recommend that you use either a CDN or a package manager like npm. This will make it easier for you to deploy your project in different environments, and easily update NetLicensing JavaScript Client when new versions are released. Nonetheless, if you prefer to integrate NetLicensing into your project manually, you can [download the release of your choice](https://github.com/Labs64/
guidechimp
guidechimp/releases) from GitHub and copy the files from the `dist` directory into your project.

Include the compiled files in your page:
```
<script src="path/to/guidechimp.min.js"></script>
```

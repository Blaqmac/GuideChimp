### 1) Using from a CDN

- jsDelivr - http://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/guidechimp
- cdnjs - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/guidechimp


### 2) Installing with Node.js / npm

Guide Chimp is available on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/guidechimp). Add the following to your `package.json` file and then run `npm install`:
```
"dependencies": {
    "guidechimp": "x.y.z"
}
```

or execute following command in your Node.js environment:

```
$ npm install guidechimp

### 3) Manual installation

We strongly recommend that you use either a CDN or a package manager like npm. This will make it easier for you to deploy your project in different environments, and easily update Guide Chimp when new versions are released. Nonetheless, if you prefer to integrate Guide Chimp into your project manually, you can [download the release of your choice](https://github.com/Labs64/guidechimp/releases) from GitHub and copy the files from the `dist` directory into your project.

Include the compiled files in your page:
```
<script src="path/to/guidechimp.min.js"></script>
```
